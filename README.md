## Why this project ?
This project was developed in 5 days and was initially created to learn basics of **<u>ReactJS</u>**
But you know, I love challenges. So I decided to make it bigger and add a solid backend in TypeScript.
So I started to learn ReactJS Frontend and Security from Backend + Matchmaking.
And... Yeah It's starting to look like a big project now. 😎

(I know, I'm always like that... Don't worry about it)
